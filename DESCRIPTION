Description: Methylation blocks are a convenient abstraction for 'loci where 
             DNA methylation changes concordantly between conditions or states'.
             Highlighted by Loyfer (Nature, 2023), these provide a mechanism to 
             reconcile data between deep (array) and wide (sequencing) assays. 
             This in turn offers a way to leverage plentiful array-based samples
             without neglecting key advantages of the sequencing-based assays,
             such as readouts of correlated methylation blocks within fragments.
             It is often the case that low-coverage sequencing data are better 
             matched by block-wise methylation rates than by locus-level ratios.
             Lightweight workflows and classes for preprocessing/QC of Illumina
             methylation data, mostly via sesame and conumee2, are provided to 
             complement the 'distillation' of data and to evaluate its fidelity.

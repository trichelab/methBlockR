Description: Methylation blocks are a convenient abstraction for 'loci where 
             DNA methylation changes concordantly by condition or state'.
             Highlighted by Loyfer (Nature, 2023), this adds a mechanism to 
             reconcile data between deep (array) & wide (sequencing) assays. 
             This also offers a way to leverage plentiful array-based samples
             without losing key advantages of the sequencing-based assays,
             such as readouts of correlated methylation within fragments.
             It is often true that low-coverage sequencing data are better 
             matched by block-wise methylation rates than locus-level ratios.
             Lightweight workflows & classes for preprocessing/QC of Illumina
             methylation data, mostly by sesame and conumee2, are provided to
             complement the 'distillation' of data and evaluate its fidelity.
             Flat & hierarchical classifiers on raw or reduced dimensions are
             supported; utilities for igv & wgbstools I/O are also included.

Description: Methylation blocks are a convenient abstraction for 'loci where 
             DNA methylation changes concordantly between conditions or states'
             proposed by Loyfer (Nature, 2023). Said blocks are also a simple 
             mechanism to exchange data back and forth between deep (array) 
             and wide (sequencing based) assays, thereby leveraging the huge 
             number of samples already profiled on the former to speed adoption 
             of the latter. The functions provided ease movement between blocks
             and loci. Note that 'fromMethBlocks' only expands the dimension
             of a methBlocked dataset to match that of a locus-level dataset; 
             without an underlying model such as NMF or a VAE, it is not trivial
             to provide anything more than an estimation of block-level
             methylation rates at each locus. That said, it sometimes is the 
             case that low-coverage or poorly-targeted loci end up better 
             approximated by a block-wise methylation rate than by local ratio.
